# The four wizards 

Ruralwater deals with **two** typologies of water supply (called
'gravity', the gravity-feed tree and 'station', a small pumping station
from a borehole). For each typology, we can approach two different
problems:

* the **hydraulic design problem** - given the required water flow,
  find the pipes that will provide such water at the minimum cost
* the **hydraulic check problem** - given the pipes, find the water flows
  and perform a control to see whether the working conditions
  do not exceed the rated limits of the installed hydraulic hardware.

Therefore, as a result we have *2 times 2 = 4* wizards that tackle respectively:

* the design problem for a gravity-fed plant 
* the check problem for a gravity-fed plant 
* the design problem for a small pumping station 
* the check problem for a small pumping station 

## 'Design' and 'check' - When to use them

The hydraulic design is useful when you need to... well, to design the
water supply. However, the check problem is useful in two situations:
(1) if you want to choose the pipes and hydraulic hardware based on your
calculations and engineering judgement and then you want to check that
your technical choices bring the amount of water you expected or cost
what you expected. (2) if you are investigating an already existing
water supply and want to check the amount of water resulting from
calculations and the water that is really flowing. If these two values
differ, then this is a hint that some pipes may be clogged or some other
hydraulic hardware (a pump, an engine) is not working properly.
